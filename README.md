# E-Commerce Frontend

This is the frontend e-commerce web application. It is built using React.js and supports both regular users and administrators with features such as user registration/login, profile management, a full admin panel (user & product management, order workflows, analytics), shopping cart & checkout, order history, wishlist/favorites—and now integrated restock alerts.
